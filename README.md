## What I learned by building this project:

React:

- Fluency in using React's basic hooks: useState, useEffect, useRef
- State management with useContext and useReducer
- Building and using custom hooks (useWindowResize, useWindowScroll, usePagination, useGlobalContext, ...)
- Data fetching
- Basic pagination
- 3rd party libraries usage ([react-widgets](https://jquense.github.io/react-widgets/))

Project tooling and configuration:

- Prototyping with [figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- Webpack configuration for React applications
- Babel integration with Webpack
- Creating and managing basic project file structure

CSS:

- BEM methodology
- `width: 100vw;` pitfall (`width: 100%;` vs `width: 100vw;`)
- Fluency with creating various layouts (Flexbox, CSS Grid)
- CSS pixels vs Hardware pixels
- Basics of UI (don't use too many colors, consistent font(s) and font size)

Other:

- GitHub's readme.md writing and formatting syntax :)
  ...and more.
